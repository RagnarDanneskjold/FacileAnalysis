Description: Provides modularized versions of analyses that are commonly
    performed over genomis data. Each analysis module provides an "iplot"
    method that provides an interactive vizualization appropriate for an 
    Rmarkdown document, and an "ixplore" function that launches a
    hyper-interactive version of the analysis using shiny gadgets.
