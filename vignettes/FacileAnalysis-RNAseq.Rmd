## Overview

This tutorial provides some examples of the common maneuvers analysts perform
when analyzying RNA-seq data. Generally speaking, some of the guiding principles
of the analyses within the FacileAnalysis package is that they are made in a
modular fashion, and their results (a `FacileAnalysisResult` object) can be:

1. transformed into tabular form via a call to `tidy()`.

2. interactivey explored by the analyst using the the `viz()` and `shine()`
   functions. These provide javascript- and shiny-based views over their
   results. The former is particularly useful when reporting results in an
   Rmarkdown document, and the later are useful when analysts are doing some
   self-exploration of their results while banging at this data through code.
   The modules used to create the shiny views can also be weaved together into
   larger interactive applications.

3. serialized into a more thorough set of interactive visualizations via a
   `report()` function, which is also suitable for use in an Rmarkdown
   document.

3. used as inputs to other analyses. In this report we show how:
   a. A `FacilePcaAnalysisResult` can be used as input to perform GSEA along
      a particular dimension.
   b. A `FacileTtestAnalysisResult` can be used as input to perform GSEA.

We'll try to exercise these within this vignette. At the end of this tutorial, 
we will also show you how to run these analysis strictly via shiny gadgets and 
manipulate the returned objects with code, as well.

We will approximately follow along with the [rnaseqGene][rnaseqGene]
bioconductor workflow, which analyzes the [airway][airway] dataset using the
[DESeq2][deseq2] framework. This vignette will perform the analyzes outlined
there, and then provide the comparable facile version of the analysis.

:::note
The FacileAnalysis package currently only provides edgeR- and limma-based
methods for differential expression analysis. This does not represent any bias
against using DESeq2, as we are in fact very fond of it, however these were the
easiest ones to wrap into this package for now. Future versions of the
FacileAnalysis package may include DESeq2 as an option for performing these
analyses (esepcially if someone would like to provide a patch)!
:::

## Data Preparation

The rnaseqGene vignette outlines how you can go from raw reads to a quantitated
experiment, that lives in a [SummarizedExperiment][SE], for example. We will
skip the data pre-processing, and just assume that your data is already made
available in some bioconductor-blessed assay container, such as a
SummarizedExperiment, DGEList, ExpressionSet, etc.

:::tip
If you are looking for help wrangling raw RNA-seq data into something like a
SummarizedExperiment object, we currently favor processing the reads using
either [salmon][salmon] or [kallisto][kallisto], then importing these results
using the [tximport][tximport] package.

### Prepare the FacileDataSet

We first need to convert our data into a `FacileDataSet`. All we need for that
is a "well-formed" standard Bioconductor assay container (SummarizedExperiment,
DGEList, ExpressionSet, etc.). By "well-formed" we mostly mean one that has some
minimal feature- and smaple-level metadata.

You'll have to install the *airway* package if you haven't done that already, 
then load the gene counts into your workspace.

```{r se-load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (FALSE) {
  BiocManager::install("airway")
}

library(DESeq2)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(FacileData)
# library(FacileAnalysis)
devtools::load_all(".")
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
theme_set(theme_bw())

data("airway", package = "airway")
```

We will need to manipulate the sample-level (`colData()`) and gene-level 
(`rowData()`) information a bit before conversion. For the `colData()` we will
subset down the columns to only keep the ones that are of phenotypic interest.
For the `rowData()`, we will have to get the corresponding gene symbols for the
ensembl identifiers in the data.

#### Sample Level Information:

We really only want to keep the `"cell"`, and `"dex"` covariates from
`colData()`, and we'll further want to relevel the `"dex"` factor as done
in the rnaseqGene workflow.

```{r se-trim}
se <- airway
cdata <- transform(
  colData(se),
  cell = cell,
  dex = relevel(dex, "untrt"))
cdata <- cdata[, c("cell", "dex")]
colData(se) <- cdata
```

:::note
When massaging the sample level metadata into shape, we advise you to ensure
that the levels of factors found in your experiment are also valid R variable
names. For instance, if you have a `time` factor, with levels like
`"24h"`, and `"48h"`, please consider re-encoding these to `"h24"` and `"h48"`.
Here's why: often times while you're running different sorts of exploratory data
analyses, through some sequence of `"gather"`-ing, `"spread"`-ing, and
joining sample-level data, it is not uncommon for factor levels to end up as
columns of a data.frame.

Ensuring that the factor loevels are "proper R variable" names up front avoids
problems you might run into when using non standard evaluation with whatever
dplyr mojo, `model.matrix(...)`, or whatever else these data often find
themselves subject to.
:::

#### Gene Leve Information

Features stored in a `FacileDataSet` need to specify the following elements:

* `feature_id`: This is the esnembl gene identifer
* `feature_type`: We use `"ensgid"` here to specify these are ensembl gene
   identifiers.
* `name`: For genes, we'll use the gene symbol
* `meta`: This can be used for anything, but for "gene" feature spaces, I like
   to put the gene biotype there

The SummarizedExperiment we have only provides the ensembl gene identifiers for
these data, so we'll have to get these information using the *biomaRt* package.
The [airway vignette][airway] says that reads were aligned with STAR against the
GRCh37 and Ensembl v75 anotations. Luckily this Ensembl version is available
via biomaRt (`listEnsemblArchives()`), so we will connect to and query that.

```r
bm <- loadNamespace("biomaRt")
mart <- bm$useMart(
  host = "feb2014.archive.ensembl.org",
  biomart = "ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL",
  dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
mart.info <- bm$getBM(
  attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "hgnc_symbol", "gene_biotype"),
  filters = "ensembl_gene_id",
  values = rownames(se),
  mart = mart)
```

The query above retrieves the data we need, but it can take a long and variable
amount of time to run. To save time while compiling this vignette, we have
serialized the result of the query, and will use that here.

```{r load-local}
mart.info <- local({
  fn <- system.file("extdata", "airway-gene-info.csv.gz",
                    package = "FacileAnalysis")
  read.csv(gzfile(fn, "rt"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
})
```

Lastly, the column names of the `gene.info` table need to be tweaked, and we
can only keep the rows that are shared between the gene information we
retrieved, and the ones that are in the SummarizedExperiment.

```{r massage-rows}
gene.info <- mart.info %>% 
  transmute(feature_id = ensembl_gene_id,
            feature_type = "ensgid",
            name = hgnc_symbol, 
            meta = gene_biotype) %>% 
  filter(feature_id %in% rownames(se), !duplicated(feature_id)) %>% 
  DataFrame()
rownames(gene.info) <- gene.info$feature_id

se <- se[gene.info$feature_id,]
rowData(se) <- gene.info
```

Now we can create the FacileDataSet with a simple call to `as.FacileDataSet()`,
by providing the groomed SummarizedExperiment, and a path to store the converted
data.

```{r}
xfds <- as.FacileDataSet(
  se, 
  path = tempfile(),
  dataset_name = "FacileAirwayDataSet",
  assay_name = "gene_counts",
  assay_description = "Gene counts from airway package",
  assay_type = "rnaseq",
  organism = "Homo sapiens")
```

:::note
The [FacileBioc][FacileBioc] package will provide functionality that will enable
you to use standard Bioconductor assay containers without physially converting
them to a `FacileDataSet`, however these data will stil need to provide the
expect feature information in their `rowData()`.
:::


### Prepare the DESeqDataSet

Let's create a `dds` object so we can perform the `DESeq2` maneuvers on these
data, and compare them with the facile version of the analyses. The worklow
suggests you to perform some exploratory analyses using variance stablised
data, so we'll calculate that here, as well.

```{r dds}
dds <- DESeqDataSet(se, design = ~ cell + dex)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)
```

## QC

### PCA plot

Let's jump to the [PCA plot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html#pca-plot) section of the rnaseqGene workflow.

Plotting the samples on their principal components in the vignette was performed
with the following command:

```{r ddspcas}
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = c("dex", "cell"))
```

That simultaneously runs the principal components analysis and plots the result.
This is fine for visualiztion purposes, but what if we wanted to work with the
PCA result further?

In the facile paradigm, we will first run the PCA, then interact with the result
of the analysis itself. Instead of just plotting the data in the reduced
dimensions, we can now identify which genes (and pathways) are highly loaded on
the principla components, as well.

Unfortutanetly, we do not have access to the variance stabilized data within
the FacileDataSet. We will try to approximate this, however, by adding a higher
`prior.count` to the normalized data (counts per milliion).

```{r}
pca <- fpca(xfds, prior.count = 5)
viz(pca, color_aes = c("dex", "cell"))
```

It's not exactly like the `vsd` data, but close enough for our purposes.

:::note
You can also run `fpca` on the `vsd` object directly, and you would have gotten
the same result as provided from the `plotPCA()` call. You can try the
following:

```{r fpcavsd, eval = FALSE}
vpca <- fpca(vsd)
viz(vpca, color_aes = c("dex", "cell"))
```
:::

We can assign covariates to different aesthetic properties, like shape, as well:

```{r}
viz(pca, color_aes = "dex", shape_aes = "cell")
```

#### Removing Batch Effects

When we perform the differential expression analysis, we will want to analyze
the treatment effects (`dex`) while controling for the celltype `cell`. The
data retrieval functions in the core `FacileData` package allow for batch
correction of normalized data using a simplified wrapper to limma's
`removeBatchEffect()` function (see `?FacileData::remove_batch_effect`).

This functionality is triggered when a covariate(s) is provided in a `batch`
argument, as shown in the code below. Note that we set `ntop` to 5000, which
uses the top 1000 most variable genes for analysis (instead of the default
500). We do this to better perform GSEA on the PCA result afterwards.

```{r}
cpca <- fpca(xfds, batch = "cell", ntop = 5000)
viz(cpca, dims = 1:3, color_aes = "dex", shape_aes = "cell")
```

:::warning
There is a [bug when mapping aesthetics to shapes](https://github.com/facileverse/FacileViz/issues/4) in the 3d plot. The `N052611`
and `N061011` cells should not both be circles.
:::

#### Interrogating a PCA Result

The benefit of having the `fpca()` result (`cpca`) in your hand is that you
can perform further action on it.

We've shown how you can "visualize" it in different ways, via the `viz()`
function. But we can also identify the genes that are "highly" loaded along
the principal components.

The `tidy()` function will return a table with the coordinates of each sample
on the PCs. `ranks()` and `signature()` returns the loadings of the genes
on each dimension, and the top `ntop` genes on each dimension, respectively.

```{r}
pc.genes <- signature(cpca, dims = 1:2, ntop = 20)
pc.genes %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  select(symbol, feature_id, dimension, score, meta)
```

We can even perform GSEA over any dimension of the PCA result via the `ffsea()`
function (Facile Feature Set Enrichment). This will rank genes by their loadings
on the specified PC of interest, then perform a pre-ranked GSEA test 
(by default, we use `limma::cameraPR`).

The core of our GSEA functionality is provided by the [multiGSEA][multiGSEA]
package. This includes easy accessor functions for geneset collection retrieval
(as a `multiGSEA::GeneSetDb` object), as well as delegation of GSEA methods for
analysis.

For this, we'll need a geneset collection stored in a `multiGSEA::GeneSetDb`
object. We'll use the MSigDB hallmark genesets for this purpose, and run both
`"cameraPR"` and `"fgsea"`.

```{r pcagsea, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gdb <- multiGSEA::getMSigGeneSetDb(c("H", "reactome"), "human", "ensembl")
pca.gsea <- ffsea(cpca, gdb, dim = 1, methods = c("cameraPR", "fgsea"))
```

You can now interactively interrogate the result of the `pca.gsea` object via
the object's `shine()` method. This will instantiated a shiny gadget that allows
you to browse through the reuslts.

```{r shinepcagsea, eval = FALSE}
# TODO: Create animated give of shine(pca.gsea)
shine(pca.gsea)
```

And you can visualize the loadings of the genes on PC1 like so.

```{r}
viz(pca.gsea, name = "HALLMARK_ADIPOGENESIS")
```

:::note
The GSEA functionality is performed by the [multiGSEA][multiGSEA] package.
Please read that vignette to learn more about its functionality. Also note
taht performing GSEA on anything but logFC's or t-statistics is new (like
gene loadings on a principal component). The "units" plotted need to be
update (ie. logFC is shown here, but that's not correct).
:::

## Differential Expression Analysis

The rnaseqGene workflow tests the differential expression of the `dex` treatment
while controling for the `cell` identity. The design formula used there was 
`~ cell + dex`, and was set during the call to `DESeqDataSet()`. We'll just
materialize these results into a data.frame:

```{r rundeseq}
dex.dds <- results(dds) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  subset(!is.na(pvalue)) %>% 
  transform(feature_id = rownames(.)) %>% 
  select(feature_id, pvalue, log2FoldChange, padj, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(pvalue)
```

On the facile side, we break down the differential expression workflow into two
explicit steps. First we define the linear model we will use for testing via the
`flm_def()` function.

To define which samples will be tested against each other, we first specify the
`covariate` used for the sample grouping. The levels of the `covariate` that
specify the samples that belong in the "numerator" of the fold change
calculation are specified by the `numer` parameter. The `denom` parameter
specifies denominator. The `batch` covarite can be used if there is a covariate
we want to control for, like `"cell"` in this case.

```{r flm-def}
xlm <- flm_def(xfds, covariate = "dex", numer = "trt", denom = "untrt",
               batch = "cell")
```

Now that we have the linear model defined, we can perform a differential
expression analysis over it via the `fdge()` function. Using this funciton,
we need to specify:

1. `assay_name`: The assay container that holds the assay data we want to 
   perform the test against. The `xfds` dataset only has one assay 
   (`"gene_counts"`) of type `"rnaseq"`(`assay_info(xfds)`), so no need to
   specify this.
2. The method to use to perform the analysis. The methods we can use are
   defined by the type of assay data the assay matrix has. Our `"gene_counts"`
   assay is of type `"rnaseq"`. So far, we support the use of the `"edgeR-qlf"`,
   `"voom"`, and `"limma-trend"` pipelines for rnaseq analysis
   (see the output from `fdge_methosd("rnaseq")`).

There are optional parameters we can pass in to tweak the analysis, for
instance:

i. `treat_lfc` accepts a log2 value which will be used to perform a test
   against a minimal thershold, using limma's (or edgeR's) *treat* framework.
ii. `filter` can be used to customize the policy used to remove lowly
   expressed genes.
iii. `use_sample_weights` can be set to `TRUE` if you want to leverage limma's
   `arrayWeights` or `voomWithQualityWeights` (depending on the `method`
   specified).

You can see more details in the `?fdge` manual page.

To make our results as comparable to the DESeq results as possible, we will
pass the gene identifiers used in the DESeq analysis into the `filter` paramater
so we get statistics on those same genes. We'll use the the voom framework for 
our initial analysis:

```{r fdge-dex}
dex.vm <- fdge(xlm, method = "voom", filter = dex.dds$feature_id)
```

The `shine()` function will enable you to interactively explore the result
via a shiny gadget. Note that since we corrected for `"cell"` in our analysis,
the sample-level expression value for each gene is shown in its batch-corrected
values. You can toggle batch correction off to see the effect it has on the
data.

```{r fdge-shine, eval=FALSE}
shine(dex.vm)
```

<!-- TODO: Add shine(dex.vm) animated gif -->

You can extract the differential statistics via the `tidy()` function. The
`ranks()` function first arranges the results by their significance, the result
of which you also pass to `tidy()`:

```{r}
vm.res <- dex.vm %>% 
  ranks(signed = FALSE) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  select(feature_id, symbol, logFC, pval, padj)
head(vm.res, 20)
```

The `viz()` function on an `fdge()` result can be used to make a volcano plot,
MA plot, or the expression profiles of a set of genes you want to observe
directly.

We can view what the differential expression of the top result looks like,
with and without batch corrected values.

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, feature_id = head(vm.res, 1))
```

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, feature_id = head(vm.res, 1), batch_correct = FALSE)
```

Or we can make a volcano plot, and highlight which of the genes were also in
DESeq2's top 50 results. By default, these plots use webgl, but we still
restrict it to only show the top 1500 genes in the volcano. You can set this
to `Inf` to show all of them.

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, type = "volcano", ntop = 1500,
    highlight = head(dex.dds$feature_id, 50))
```

... or an MA plot ...

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, type = "ma", ntop = 1500,
    highlight = head(dex.dds$feature_id, 50))
```

How concordant are the DESeq2 and voom results?

```{r}
cmp <- dex.dds %>% 
  inner_join(select(tidy(dex.vm), feature_id, symbol, logFC, pval, padj, t),
             by = "feature_id")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cmp, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = logFC)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  xlab("DESeq2 log2FC") +
  ylab("voom log2FC") +
  ggtitle("logFC comparison bewteen DESeq2 and facile-voom result")
```

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

As is the case in the PCA -> GSEA analysis performed above, GSEA here is
performed downstream of the differential expression result. We need to specify
the geneset collection to use for GSEA, as well as the methods performed.

```{r}
dge.gsea <- ffsea(dex.vm, gdb, methods = c("enrichtest", "cameraPR"))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
shine(dge.gsea)
```
